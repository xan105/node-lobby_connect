====Goldberg Steam Emulator====

An emulator that supports LAN multiplayer without steam.

How to use: Replace the steam_api(64).dll (libsteam_api.so on linux) from the game with mine. (For linux make sure to use the right build).
Put a steam_appid.txt file that contains the appid of the game right beside it if there isn't one already.


If your game has an original steam_api(64).dll older than may 2016 (Properties->Digital Signatures->Timestamp) you might have to add a steam_interfaces.txt beside my emulator library if the game isn't working. 
This file contains interface versions, an example (for resident evil 5) is provided.
If you are on Windows, look in the tools folder for a program to generate the steam_interfaces.txt file.
If you are on linux you can look in the linux/tools folder (or the scripts folder in the repo) for a script to generate the steam_interfaces.txt file.
You can also just get a hex editor and search for them (Search for the string: SteamUser0) in the original steam_api dll (or libsteam_api.so on linux) or look in the ini of a crack that works on that game.


If the game has DRM (other than steamworks) you need to remove/crack it first.


Default save location: C:\Users\<Your windows user name>\AppData\Roaming\Goldberg SteamEmu Saves\
For linux: $XDG_DATA_HOME/Goldberg SteamEmu Saves/ or if it's not defined: $HOME/.local/share/Goldberg SteamEmu Saves/

In the settings folder in that save location you will find 3 files (if you have used the emulator at least once):
account_name.txt (Edit this file to change your name)
listen_port.txt (Edit this file if you want to change the UDP/TCP port the emulator listens on (You should probably not change this because everyone needs to use the same port or you won't find yourselves on the network))
user_steam_id.txt (this is where your steam id is saved, you can change it (if your saves for a game are locked to a specific steam id see below for a way to change it on a per game basis) but it has to be valid)
language.txt (Edit this to change the language the emulator will report to the game, default is english, it must be a valid steam language name or the game might have weird behaviour (list provided at the end of this readme))

Note that these are global so you won't have to change them for each game. For game unique stuff (stats and remote storage) a folder is created with the appid of the game.
If you want to change your steam_id on a per game basis, simply create a settings folder in the game unique directory (Full path: C:\Users\<Your windows user name>\AppData\Roaming\Goldberg SteamEmu Saves\<appid>\settings)
In that settings folder create a user_steam_id.txt file that contains the valid steam id that you want to use for that game only.

You can also make the emu ignore certain global settings by using a force_account_name.txt, force_language.txt, force_listen_port.txt or force_steamid.txt that you put in the <path where my emu lib is>\steam_settings\ folder.
See the steam_settings.EXAMPLE folder for an example.

If for some reason you want it to save in the game directory you can create a file named local_save.txt right beside steam_api(64).dll (libsteam_api.so on linux)
The only thing that file should contain is the name of the save directory. This can be useful if you want to use different global settings like a different account name or steam id for a particular game.
Note that this save directory will be beside where the emu dll (or .so) is which may not be the same as the game path.

DLC:
By default the emulator will try to unlock all DLCs (by returning true when the game calls the BIsDlcInstalled function). If the game uses the other function you will need to
provide a list of DLCs to my emulator. To do this first create a steam_settings folder right beside where you put my emulator. 
In this folder, put a DLC.txt file. (path will be <path where my emu lib is>\steam_settings\DLC.txt)
If the DLC file is present, the emulator will only unlock the DLCs in that file. If the file is empty all DLCs will be locked.
The contents of this file are: appid=DLC name
See the steam_settings.EXAMPLE folder for an example.

Languages:
You can include a steam_settings\supported_languages.txt file with a list of languages that the game supports. If the global emu language setting is not in this list of languages the emu will default to the first language in the list.
See the steam_settings.EXAMPLE folder for an example.

Depots:
This is pretty rare but some games might use depot ids to see if dlcs are installed. You can provide a list of installed depots to the game with a steam_settings\depots.txt file.
See the steam_settings.EXAMPLE folder for an example.

Subscribed Groups:
Some games like payday 2 check which groups you are subscribed in and unlock things based on that. You can provide a list of subscribed groups to the game with a steam_settings\subscribed_groups.txt file.
See steam_settings.EXAMPLE\subscribed_groups.EXAMPLE.txt for an example for payday 2.

App paths:
Some rare games might need to be provided one or more paths to app ids. For example the path to where a dlc is installed. This sets the paths returned by the Steam_Apps::GetAppInstallDir function.
See steam_settings.EXAMPLE\app_paths.EXAMPLE.txt for an example.
This file should be put here: <path where my emu lib is>\steam_settings\app_paths.txt
Note that paths are treated as relative paths from where the steam_api dll is located.

Mods:
Put your mods in the steam_settings\mods\ folder. The steam_settings folder must be placed right beside my emulator dll.
Mod folders must be a number corresponding to the file id of the mod.
See the steam_settings.EXAMPLE folder for an example.

Steam appid:
The best place to put your steam_appid.txt is in the steam_settings folder because this is where the emulator checks first.
If there is no steam_appid.txt in the steam_settings folder it will try opening it from the run path of the game. If one isn't there it will try to load it from beside my steam api dll.
The steam appid can also be set using the SteamAppId or SteamGameId env variables (this is how real steam tells games what their appid is).

Offline mode:
Some games that connect to online servers might only work if the steam emu behaves like steam is in offline mode. If you need this create a offline.txt file in the steam_settings folder.

Disable networking:
If for some reason you want to disable all the networking functionality of the emu you can create a disable_networking.txt file in the steam_settings folder. This will of course break all the
networking functionality so games that use networking related functionality like lobbies or those that launch a server in the background will not work.

Custom Broadcast ips:
If you want to set custom ips (or domains) which the emulator will send broadcast packets to, make a list of them, one on each line in: Goldberg SteamEmu Saves\settings\custom_broadcasts.txt
If the custom ips/domains are specific for one game only you can put the custom_broadcasts.txt in the steam_settings\ folder.
An example is provided in steam_settings.EXAMPLE\custom_broadcasts.EXAMPLE.txt

Achievements, Items or Inventory:
Create a folder named steam_settings right beside steam_api.dll if there isn't one already. In that folder, create a file named items.json and/or achievements.json which will contain every item/achievement you want to have in your game.
An example can be found in steam_settings.EXAMPLE that works with Killing Floor 2.
The items.json syntax is simple, you SHOULD validate your .json file before trying to run your game or you won't have any item in your inventory. Just look for "online json validator" on your web brower to valide your file.
You can use https://steamdb.info/ to list items and attributes they have and put them into your .json.
Keep in mind that some item are not valid to have in your inventory. For example, in PayDay2 all items below item_id 50000 will make your game crash.
items.json should contain all the item definitions for the game, default_items.json is the quantity of each item that you want a user to have initially in their inventory. By default the user will have no items.

You can use the scripts\stats_schema_achievement_gen\achievements_gen.py script in the emu source code repo to generate a achievements config from a steam: appcache\stats\UserGameStatsSchema_{appid}.bin file.

Leaderboards:
By default the emulator assumes all leaderboards queried by the game (FindLeaderboard()) exist and creates them with the most common options (sort method descending, display type numeric)
In some games this default behavior doesn't work and so you may need to tweak which leaderboards the game sees.
To do that, you can put a leaderboards.txt file in the steam_settings folder. 
An empty leaderboards.txt makes the emu behave as if any leaderboard queried by the game using FindLeaderboard does not exist.
The format is: LEADERBOARD_NAME=sort method=display type
For the sort methods: 0 = none, 1 = ascending, 2 = descending
For the display type: 0 = none, 1 = numeric, 2 = time seconds, 3 = milliseconds
An example can be found in steam_settings.EXAMPLE

Stats:
By default this emulators assumes all stats do not exist unless they have been written once by the game. This works for the majority of games but some games might read a stat for the first time
and expect a default value to be read when doing so. To set the type for each stat along with the default value, put a stats.txt file in the steam_settings/ folder.
The format is: STAT_NAME=type=default value
The type can be: int, float or avgrate
The default value is simply a number that represents the default value for the stat.

You can use the scripts\stats_schema_achievement_gen\achievements_gen.py script in the emu source code repo to generate a stats config from a steam: appcache\stats\UserGameStatsSchema_{appid}.bin file.

Build id:
Add a steam_settings\build_id.txt with the build id if the game doesn't show the correct build id and you want the emu to give it the correct one.
An example can be found in steam_settings.EXAMPLE

SteamHTTP:
Add a steam_settings\http folder. The folder should contain the domain name and path to the files that will be returned by steamHTTP like so:
For example this url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
Would be: steam_settings\http\en.wikipedia.org\wiki\Main_Page
The Main_Page file would contain the data returned by the steamHTTP api when it tries to access: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
An example that was made for payday 2 can be found in steam_settings.EXAMPLE


Support for CPY steam_api(64).dll cracks: See the build in the experimental folder.

Notes:
You must all be on the same LAN for it to work.

IMPORTANT:
Do not run more than one steam game with the same appid at the same time on the same computer with my emu or there might be network issues (dedicated servers should be fine though).

Overlay (Note: at the moment this feature is only enabled in the windows experimental builds):
The overlay can be disabled by putting a file named disable_overlay.txt in the steam_settings folder. This is for games that depend on the steam overlay to let people join multiplayer games.
Use SHIFT-TAB to open the overlay.

Controller (Note: at the moment this feature is only enabled in the windows experimental builds and the linux builds):
SteamController/SteamInput support is limited to XInput controllers. If your controller is not XInput, there are many tools (at least for windows) that you can use to make it emulate an XInput one.
Steam uses things called action sets for controller configuration. An action set is a group of action names. Action names are bound to buttons, triggers or joysticks.
The emulator needs to know for each action set, which button is linked to which action name. Create a ACTION_SET_NAME.txt file in the steam_settings\controller folder for every action set the game uses.
To see an example for the game Crystar see: steam_settings.EXAMPLE\controller.EXAMPLE
In the action set txt files the format is:
For digital actions (buttons, on or off): ACTION_NAME=BUTTON_NAME
For analog actions (joysticks, triggers): ACTION_NAME=ANALOG_NAME=input source mode
Actions can be bound to more than one button by separating the buttons with , like this: ACTION_NAME=A,B

If you want to configure a game yourself, find the xbox360 or xbox one vdf file for the game and you should be able to figure things out.
You can also use the scripts\controller_config_generator\parse_controller_vdf.py script in the emu source code repo.

For example to get the vdf file for the game Crystar: https://steamdb.info/app/981750/config/
If you look at: steamcontrollerconfigdetails, you will see something like: 1779660455/controller_type: controller_xbox360
1779660455 refers to a file id that you can dl using your favorite steam workshop downloader site.
The url would be: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1779660455

The glyphs directory contains some glyphs for the controller buttons for the games that use the GetGlyphForActionOrigin function.
If you want to use the real steam glyphs instead of the free ones in the example directory copy them from: <Steam Directory>\tenfoot\resource\images\library\controller\api folder.
